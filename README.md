data-eater
==========

data-eater is a web data miner project which supports sessions by copying-over the cookie and existing form fields. It works by first pulling the html code then making it xhtml compliant using xmltidy or tidylib and then it will use xsl-transformations to extract needed values.

Current state:
Currently the project is at very basic stage. You might not find the code that compiles. If you want to contribute, let me know through private message. I will explain this to you in detail.

More information:
For more information. See our wiki pages.


UPDATE: We are currently working on Scripting Language, Look at the Wiki Page for Scripting Language to find out the latest. Scripting Language is currently in the analysis phase. We are planning on using boost-spirit for the implementation.
