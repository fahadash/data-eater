data-eater
==========

data-eater is a web data miner project which supports sessions by copying-over the cookie and existing form fields. It works by first pulling the html code then making it xhtml compliant using xmltidy or tidylib and then it will use xsl-transformations to extract needed values.

Current state:
Currently the project is at very basic stage. You might not find the code that compiles. If you want to contribute, let me know through private message. I will explain this to you in detail.
